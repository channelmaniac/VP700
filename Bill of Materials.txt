Bill of Materials:

This will be short as the card is not complicated! Part numbers not included as I had all the
parts in my stash except for the HC573 which came from Mouser. I have an affinity to use 
Mouser for my parts needs as I live a 45 minute drive from them and get parts next day if I 
order early enough. 

Parts needed: 

1x MC14515 or equivalent 4-bit transpare latch/4-to-16 line decoder
1x 74HC573 Octal D-type latch with 3-state outputs
  OR 74HCT573 Ocal D-type latch with 3-state outputs
  OR 74HC574 Octal Edge-Triggered D-Type Flip-Flops with 3-state outputs
  OR 74HCT574 Octal Edge-Triggered D-Type Flip-Flops with 3-state outputs
1x 28C256 32K x 8 EEPROM 
  OR 28C64 8K x 8 EEPROM
  OR 27C64 8K x 8 EPROM
  OR 2764 8K x 8 EPROM
1x 1N914 / 1N4148 Diode
1x 18-22pf Ceramic (disk or MLCC) capacitor
1x 100nf / .1uf / 104 Ceramic (disk or MLCC) capacitor
1x 100uf Electrolytic capacitor
1x 24-pin .6" wide dual wipe socket
1x 24-pin .6" wide dual wipe socket
1x 20-pin dual wipe socket

And 1 of the PCBs from your favorite PCB manufacturer. I used JLCPCB.

Either the 74HC or HCT family latch will work for this. The important part is that either act as
CMOS inputs with low input current orf 1uA max to keep from being too much of a load to the VIP
which had 1 TTL load listed in the documentation. The outputs for either chip will drive up to 
"15 LSTTL loads" but are only driving the upper address lines to the EEPROM or EPROM being used.

The value of the timing bodge capacitor has been tested at 18pf with a ceramic 1802 CPU installed 
on the VIP and at 22pf with a plastic CPU installed on the VIP. The PCB was designed to use a 
28C256 with the upper address lines grounded. Smaller sized 28 pin devices will work and the 
28C64 and 2764 chips have been successfully tested.

At the slow CPU speeds of the 1802 in the VIP, slower cycle time EPROMs (300ns) have been tested
and should work fine. The 14515 used was from Motorola and the HC573 was from Texas Instruments. 
This should not matter and other manufacturer parts should work fine. Other families (LS, ALS, F,
H, S, etc.) of the HC573 have not been tested and should not be used as the VIP documentation 
specifies using CMOS. The documemtation states to use CMOS buffer chips if using TTL on the
expansion interface.
